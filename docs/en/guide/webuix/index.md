# Why WebUI X?

WebUI X is the next-generation framework for building modular, secure, and high-performance WebUI applications. It offers significant improvements over Legacy KernelSU WebUI, making it the ideal choice for developers. Below are the key reasons to switch:

## 🚀 **Key Advantages**

### 1. **Enhanced Security**
   - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restricts unsafe scripts and resources, preventing XSS attacks.  
   - **Kill Shell:** Automatically terminates background processes to block unauthorized code execution.  
   - **Strict Isolation:** Plugins and modules run in controlled environments, reducing vulnerabilities.  

### 2. **Superior Performance**
   - **Smart Caching:** Configurable `Cache Max Age` and resource caching improve load times.  
   - **Optimized Rendering:** Features like `Window Resize` and `Auto Style StatusBars` ensure smooth UI adaptation.  

### 3. **Powerful Debugging Tools**
   - **Built-in Eruda Console:** Auto-injected for real-time debugging.  
   - **Remote URL Debugging:** Test locally via `http://localhost` for faster iterations.  
   - **Developer Mode:** Reveals module IDs and advanced metrics for troubleshooting.  

### 4. **Extensibility & Customization**
   - **Plugin Ecosystem:** Supports APK and DEX plugins (e.g., [WXU](https://github.com/MMRLApp/WXU)) for limitless functionality.  
   - **SPA-Friendly:** `History Fallback` ensures seamless navigation in single-page apps.  
   - **UI Control:** Customize back-button behavior, refresh interceptors, and exit confirmations.  

### 5. **Modern UX Features**
   - **Pull-to-Refresh:** User-friendly reloading (beta).  
   - **Dynamic Theming:** Match status bars to app themes for visual consistency.  

### 6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Works with **KernelSU (Next), SukiSU Ultra, Magisk, APatch**, and even **non-rooted devices**.

|------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Security**           | CSP, Kill Shell, Isolation      | Basic sandboxing            |
| **Debugging**          | Eruda, Remote URL               | Limited dev tools           |
| **Plugins**            | APK/DEX support                 | N/A                         |
| **Performance**        | Smart caching, UI optimizations | N/A                         |
| **SPA Support**        | History fallback                | Manual routing              |

## 🛠️ **Getting Started**
1. **Install WebUI X** via GitHub or Google Play Store.  
2. Explore your installed modules like `App Nuker` and `bindhosts`.  
3. Tweak settings in `Developer Mode` for advanced control.  

> 💡 **Tip:** Enable `Auto Open Eruda` in the settings to debug WebUIs instantly!  

**Ready to upgrade?** WebUI X delivers **security, speed, and flexibility** — making it the future of Android WebUI frameworks.
